# Sales Agency Backend Server
Backend server for the Sales Agency front-end. This server contains all MongoDB models that are to be used mostly for managing user-accounts. 

## Scraping
The atlas-scraping.py file contains the source code for scraping data from a third party database website. This data is then uploaded to Google Spreadsheets and also to the MongoDB server. The front-end fetches the data from MongoDB to depict them as leaderboards on a web page.
